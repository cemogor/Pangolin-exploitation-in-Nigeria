# Pangolin-exploitation-in-Nigeria
This project examines the local exploitation of pangolins and investigates the drivers behind pangolin hunting, drawing on data from 809 hunters and meat vendors in Nigeria, the world's largest hub for pangolin trafficking.

The project includes two scripts:

    01. Wrangling: This script contains all the cleaned datasets described in the manuscript and handles data preprocessing for models. It also includes code to create Figures 1, 2, and 4, as well as most of the supplementary materials.

    02. Modelling: This script includes code to replicate the two linear models described in the manuscript, along with model diagnostic plots.

All data are provided, and data descriptions are included in the respective scripts.
