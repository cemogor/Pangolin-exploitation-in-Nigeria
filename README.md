# Pangolin-exploitation-in-Nigeria
This project examines the local exploitation of pangolins and investigates the drivers behind pangolin hunting, drawing on data from 809 hunters and meat vendors in Nigeria, the world's largest hub for pangolin trafficking.

The project contains two scripts: 01. Wrangling, which contains all clean datasets used described in the manuscript and pre-processsing of the data for models; it also contains codes to create Figs.1,2,4 and most supplementary materials. The second script, 02. Modelling, contains codes to replicate the two linear models described in the manuscript, as well as, model diagnostic plots. 

All data are provided; data desctiptions are in the respective scripts.
